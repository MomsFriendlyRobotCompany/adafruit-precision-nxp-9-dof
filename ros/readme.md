# ROS Driver

This doesn't work yet (maybe *never*?)

1. `mkdir -p catkin_ws/src`
1. `cd catkin_ws/src`
1. Get repo: `git clone https://github.com/repo.git`
1. Back to workspace: `cd ..`
1. Install needed dependencies: `rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y`
1. `catkin_make`
1. `source devel/setup.bash`
